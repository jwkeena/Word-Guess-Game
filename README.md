# the-office-character-guessing-game
An Office-themed hangman-style game built with vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. 

# goals
Early in my coding career, I challenged myself to create this hangman-style game as a single JavaScript object. I also just wanted to entertain my friends who love the show. Players can choose whether to guess full names or first names only, and are given one hint per round. Using relative and absolute positioning, players are presented with a GIF of the corresponding character on the TV display.
